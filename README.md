This repository contains the implementation and analysis of parallel versions of Dijkstra's algorithm using MPI and OpenMP. 
The project benchmarks sequential and parallel performance on large-scale graph datasets (DBLP and Amazon), using METIS for graph partitioning (OpenMP only). 
Speedup and scalability are visualized and documented.
